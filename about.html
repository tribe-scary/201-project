    <div><p>My name is Robert Ball and I am a software developer enrolled in Code Fellows coding bootcamp. I am also
        concurrently enrolled at the University of Arizona working on a post bachelorette in cyber operations. My goal
        is to become a front end developer or work in cyber security forensics. Regardless, I see my future as being
        heavily involved in the tech and IT world.
        <br><br>
        Prior to transitioning into tech, I was in the Army where I served as an Infantry officer for 9 years. My time
        in the military helped me to hone my leadership style and team management skills. While in the Army I was able
        to travel around the world and had the opportunity to work with partner nation forces from around the globe.
        <br><br>
        I’m originally from Oregon and graduated from the University of Montana with a BA in History.

    <div><p>I am a bilingual California native transitioning from the Army and actively looking to pivot careers from
        healthcare to software development. I have about 10 years of healthcare experience from both the Army and
        Civilian sector ranging from managing military and civilian staff in a clinic setting to maintaining competency
        in medical documentation programs. License in Vocational Nursing obtained through an accelerated and
        multi-disciplined 52 week U.S Army Program. I am a team leader that emphasizes clear, open minded communication,
        respect and constructive feedback on any subject. Skills and accomplishments that set me apart are my
        interpersonal and critical thinking skills that have led to opportunities in leading individuals in projects and
        attending military schools to advance my skills in nursing and leadership. My exposure to software development
        is minimal but my interest has highly grown through the pandemic with the emphasis on computer communication and
        interaction and currently enrolled with Code Fellows, completing the basic coding/Java boot camp with an
        expected graduation in the fall of 2022. I know my resiliency, open mindedness and teamwork experience in the
        military and health care field make me an exceptional candidate in contributing in any software development
        opportunity.</p></div>
